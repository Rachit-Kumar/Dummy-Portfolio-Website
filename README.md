# Dummy-Portfolio-Website
This dummy portfolio website was created purely as a personal project after completing my 10th board exams. All the information presented on this website is fictional and does not reflect any real person's portfolio or qualifications. It was just made as a side project and hosted on pythonanywhere.com  

# After creating this project it was later converted into a Django project.
The Purpose of this Project to be converted into Django was to host it on pythonanywhere.com, which offers free hosting. 
All the Django files of this project are uploaded as a zip file.
